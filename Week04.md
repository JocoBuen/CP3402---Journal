## Learning Activities and Resources

Task: Our eventual goal is to have a good local development environment setup and be able to deploy our local sites to "production". Note that you don't have to have this totally figured out today; it will take time to experiment with different options and adjust your system as you learn and try new things.

For this prac, you need to be able to demonstrate a dynamic site with a database (either a CMS or code & database) running on your localhost. You can do this with screenshots that show the site and URL in your browser and a description of what you used to setup your local environment, or a live demo to your tutor.

For local development environment, I tried to setup two platform such as VVV vagrant and docker compose. And tried to study the advantages of having a local environment. This task is very handy for the group assignment so we can develop the different features and content of the site using local dev and merging it on the end to finalized the web development.

## Content Insights

Having a local development environment is a very handy and useful. It serves as a training ground for a beginner like me to avoid breaking the live site. Editing the website locally is much faster than of editing on live host. These features gives me more confidence on editing website without fear of breaking the live website. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Having a local development environment when developing a live website with wordpress is an essential. I understand that this way you will have safe way to modify the website without breaking it if something happens because you are directly doing it on a local computer. It is also one efficient way to test or try something new for your website before deploying it to the live website. Having local dev environment can also split the task to multiple creator by having a copy of the live website and finish the task separately. This type of development will be useful for a real life situation in the future, if I will be in a team that needs to create/develop a certain feature for a website. Learning this type of development will surely be much more interesting if I can practice it more and use more often.
