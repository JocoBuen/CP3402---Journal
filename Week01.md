## Learning Activities and Resources

For the first activity, I have decided to create a single-page website with multiple sections. I also used bootstrap for more responsiveness to the website. Watching learning videos at LinkedIn Learning helped me to build the website.

## Estimated Hours

I spent a total of 32 hours to complete the web site. And tried my best to watch lecture videos. 

## Content Insights

I found single web-page website design more user friendly than the practical multi page web design. Navigating through all the pages sometimes take more time than just scrolling one page. It is more enganging to browse the single web page. Publishing the website is a new challenge since it was a new experience making me more interested in CMS.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

After watching all the lecture videos and looking from my previous works, I can now understand more on how to design a better and user friendly website. Using best practices and putting more advance css and bootstrap styles was an added skill to my arsenal, this can help me build and design more efficiently according to the website requirements. From this weeks learning activity, I have concluded that I can develop a very simple web design in a very short period of time. This type of skill can be handy for future front-end web designing jobs.
