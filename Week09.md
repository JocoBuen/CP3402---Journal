**SCSS is like a super-charged version of regular CSS!** It makes your website styles way easier to organize and understand. It's like having a toolbox full of cool features to design with, instead of just a pile of loose nails and screws (regular CSS).

With SCSS, you can build a personal style library, just like the one I made for the practical. This means you can reuse all those fancy styles on future websites without having to rewrite everything each time. It's a major time-saver!

Basically, SCSS takes you from writing out every single CSS detail by hand to having a powerful system that keeps things clean and organized.
