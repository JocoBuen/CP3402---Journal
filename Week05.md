This week, create a post on your LinkedIn profile that outlines one lesson you've learned to date in this subject. You can make up something new, or copy something from your learning journal. Edit it to suit your public audience. Don't have a LinkedIn profile? Now is the time to make one... and here's why.

Setup a child theme from my first assignment which useis based from variations. I have also read and watch some of the videos from the LinkedIn Learning course. I found this task will help me in the future if I will be having a project that needs to be updated or will create a new website based from a certain theme without worrying any updates or changes from the parent theme.

## Content Insights

Child theme is a safe customizations for website developing on WordPress, it lets you make changes without affecting the original theme. It is also a good learning ground from creating a wordpress theme than creating a theme from scratch. This feature is also a good practice to teach myself of how a WordPress theme works. I also have a little introduction to PHP, on how I can connect the my changes from the parent to the child theme.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

After finishing the practical, I found that creating child theme and having a local development environment is something similar in terms of customising or making changes freely by yourself. Creating a child theme is a great stepping stone on WordPress Theme creation. This skill will be handy for future opportunities to become a Front End Web Design Developer. Learning some basic CSS, I can now implement and showcase them in an professional way by creating and developing a publish child theme.
