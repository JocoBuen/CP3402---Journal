## Learning Activities and Resources

This week I look up some of the resources available to setup a wordpress site. I go with the option of Digital Ocean and Microsoft Azure Student packs. After reading some of there documentations on how to setup WordPress. I had some issues with regards to Digital Ocean, the DNS I created for the start up site is not working, apparently I need to buy my own DNS. For that reason I swithed to Microsoft Azure and it was a pretty straight forward setup following the documentations. The theme I used that was closed to my Joomla site was Variations, after successfully setup the wordpress site, I watch and followed some of the step on creating a wordpress site from the recommended learning resources. From my experience to setup wordpress website from different hosting sites, this will be usefull for my group assignment so I can discuss options to host our website without charges.

## Estimated Hours

Total hours spent to setup and create a wordpress site was 95 hours, including the time spent for the assignment and watching videos from the resources

## Content Insights

For this task I was introduce to web hosting, domain names and the importance of having a good practice of a good layout. This allows me to change or customize the layout by editing some of the featured style of the theme, it is also possible to add some features of the site by adding plugins for the website. It is much easier to create website with CMS and when you have an editor like WordPress. I know after this there will be more advance stuff to create or publish a fully functional website.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This weeks task taught me on how to use the resources around me, I got stuck at some point but instead of finding the answer to that problem. I tried to checked if I can use another option to complete my goal to setup a web hosting, install wordpress and create basic editing of wordpress themes. I can use this understanding for my future project to keep moving forward when I am stuck on something, can be useful to my future group assignment.
