## Learning Activities and Resources

For the last week, we've been busy getting ready for the presentation and making sure we have everything done for the assignment. We met to figure out what needed to be done, and practicing our presentation was really helpful. We prepared all the slides and scripts, and made sure everything was finalized by adding or taking things out as needed.

## Estimated Hours

Total hours spent for rehearsing and having the final presentation was 6 hours.

## Content Insights

Deciding on the development and deployment workflow for our project wasn't easy. We considered both our team's experience and the practicality of different tools. This presentation will explain the entire process, from development to deployment. This will be a valuable resource for anyone taking over the project in the future,  whether it's us as a team or a new developer working for our client.  In short, the presentation will be a comprehensive overview of the project, including the tools used and the workflow we followed. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This presentation serves a dual purpose: it streamlines onboarding for future developers by clearly outlining the project's development process and workflow.  But the benefits extend beyond this project.  Crafting a compelling presentation is a valuable skill for future endeavors.  It allows you to effectively showcase your work and hone your project management abilities â€“ from organizing  resources to presenting complex information.  By honing this skill, I'm confident my future presentations will be far more impactful.
