## Estimated Hours

I spent a total of 37 hours to complete the web site. 

## Content Insights

It was a long journey creating a website to a platform that is very new to you. But with proper lectures and some courses that I found, I think I did a good job at applying them to the website I created. Joomla is very user friendly to use in building website, because of its popularity there is a lot of extensions and modules you can use for your project. Learning Joomla will help me understand wordpress better, which I can use for the group work and for the first assignment. Overall it was like a roller coaster ride, had a lot of ups and down but at the end, the feeling of completing a simple website brings excitement and satisfaction. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Joomla is a very popular CMS, it is widely used by professionals. Me experiencing to create and publish a simple website, makes me feel that I can still excel. With all the essential learning from Joomla, I should be able to adopt to any CMS platform as they all have the same concept to create websites. I want to pursue this type of web development, with more learning and more practice. In conclusion, this week activity is more on an eye openning to the world of CMS and for more opportunities on the future.
